Dear Sir,

I, Chayanika Das, am a student of National Institute of Technology, Karnataka, pursuing my Bachelor of Technology degree in the Department of Chemical Engineering, with a CGPA of 8.67/10.00 (till 3rd semester, which ended in 2016 December). I am very eager to learn about the new emerging technologies that have application as well as implementation in the various domains of Chemical Engineering. 

You are widely known for your findings and achievements in the field of Waste Water Technology and your vast knowledge and expertise in the subject. Hence, it would be an immense opportunity for me if you would consider my request to do a summer research project under your able guidance during the summer of 2017 (after the term of 4th Semester). This will function as a basis for my B. Tech. project and any other research endeavors I might embark upon later.

Our summer break is from 1 May 2017- 26 July 2017 (tentative).

Please find attached my Curriculum Vitae and Statement Of Purpose.

Thank You for your time and consideration. looking forward for a positive reply.


Yours sincerely,
Chayanika Das
