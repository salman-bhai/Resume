Respected Sir,
 
My name is Salman Shah and I am currently pursuing my 4th Semester (2nd Year) in the Department of Information Technology at National Institute of Technology, Karnataka.

As a part of my continued learning, I would like to apply for a summer internship at your university for the Summer of 2017. My main area of interest is Machine Learning and currently I am pursuing two projects on Deep  Learning with NLP with my fellow batch-mates here at NITK Surathkal both of which can be found on my Resume and GitHub profile.

I am sure this internship will be one of the best learning phases of my life, leading to a good career in Information Technology that I would like to pursue. Since I would like to also go ahead with my masterâ€™s and Ph.D, this would definitely help me fulfill that ambition giving me the right impetus and insight on research and development related to Machine Learning and its applications that can be applied to real-world problems.

I have attached my Resume and my Statement of Purpose with the mail. The link to my GitHub profile can be found here. I am also a resident of the city of Mumbai hence accommodation will not be a problem for me as well.

I look forward to hearing from you once again.

I thank you once again for your kind consideration.

Thanking you,
Sincerely Yours
(Salman Shah).
